i do not know git, i would try and upload code as much as i can.
main interst is cyber security and networking, but i do not know what kind of projects i should make to be related to infosec and networking.
i might need help on so many levels, dont ask me about anything that i didnt dut inside a project unless you are going to help me with that which i'd be so greatfull.
is there ppl that put 3d projects? if so then i do that too!
ty bye!!
